# NixieDriver_ESP

> An Arduino library for making the Doayee Nixie Driver work with the ESP8266

I'm not the author of this library. I'm just redistributing it here on GitHub for archival purposes, which I believe is allowed according to the terms of its [license](LICENSE). Also, I need it here so I can use it as a submodule for my [aic-nixie](https://github.com/IllyaMoskvin/aic-nixie) project.


## Credits

 * Original `NixieDriver` library was written by Thomas Cousins for http://doayee.co.uk 
 * `NixieDriver_ESP` was adapted from the original `NixieDriver` library by Joe Pasqua
